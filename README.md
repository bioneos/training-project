# Bio::Neos Development Skeleton

## Project Overview
We were tasked with designing and creating a development skeleton for future Bio::Neos interns to experiment with and build on. Given several options for the framework, we chose Nuxt.js and Vue due to their aesthetic appeal, strong documentation, and supportive community. Our primary goal was to develop an application with some loose ends to give future developers footholds to make it their own and gain valuable learning experiences. Additional goals included experimenting with new technologies, gaining a better understanding of the web development process, and creating a project that could serve as a showcase of our work.

### Project Goals and Uses
- **Primary Goal:** Provide a base for future development interns to use as a jumping-off point.
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Experiment with unfamiliar technologies.
  - Enhance understanding of the web development process.
  - Create a demonstrative project for career development.

### Future Enhancements
- Branch and customize for personal projects/career development
- Use as guide for future interns

### Technologies used
- Nuxt 3.12
- Vue.js (either 2.7 or 3)
- MySQL
- Docker
- Bcrypt
- Prisma 5.15.0

## Getting Started

### Ensure you have the following installed: 
- Docker


### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bioneos/training-project.git
   ```
2. **Set up the environment variables:**
- Create a `.env` file.
- Copy the contents of `dotenv.example` to your `.env` and update them with your desired values.

### Running the project

1. **Start the docker containers**

    ```sh 
    docker compose up --build 
    ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bioneos/training-project.git
   ```
2. **Set up the environment variables:**
- Create a `.env` file.
- Copy the contents of `dotenv.example` to your `.env` and update them with your desired values.

### Running the project

1. **Start the docker containers**

    ```sh 
    docker compose up --build 
    ```

2. **Access the application:**
- Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```sh
    http://localhost:${APP_PORT} 

    ```
    APP_PORT is the port value you set up in your `.env` file.

- The correct link will also come up in your container log when starting up the Docker container :

3. **Accessing your development environment**
- We want to write our code while inside of the app container created by docker (training-project-app-1). This can be done differently based on the IDE being used. We will show you how to do it in VSCode.

  - VSCode
    1. If not installed already, make sure you have the Remote Explorer extension installed.

    2. Navigate to the Remote Explorer tab.

    3. Navigate to the training-project-app-1 container and click on the "Attach in current window option".

    4. Now you can edit the files from within the container! To view the docker logs while in the container, navigate to the remote explorer tab and right-click the container. Select the "Show Container Log" option. Then the container will be displayed in the terminal tab!
